# DLT-for-2-view-homography-estimation

The goal of this task is to the DLT algorithm to estimate a 3x3 homography matrix.

Manually pick any six corresponding coplanar points in the images left.jpg and right.jpg and get their image coordinates.
In doing this step you may find it useful to check the Matlab function ginput. This is however only optional.
Calculate the 3x3 homography matrix between the two images, from the above 6 pairs of corresponding points, using DLT algorithm. You are required to implement your function in the following syntax.
